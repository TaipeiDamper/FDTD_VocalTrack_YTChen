This is a 1-dimentional (1-D) finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) vocal tract model, which controls the vowel by setting the cross-sectional area with different value.

% Analysis %
Set v_Gl (Glottos input) as an impulse to see formant frequency.
Set v_GL (Glottos input) to be semi-sinewave (positive value of sin) to hear differenct vowel.

The corresponding energy analysis would be shown in figures.
If it is impulse input (delta function), energy conservation would be recovered.
If loss is introduced, the energy in the vocal tract would decay, and all energy in the system is still collected.
